=================

Project Title:
AI-Based Customer Support System

Description:
AI Support System is a backend-driven intelligent application designed to
automate and streamline customer support operations. The system analyzes
user queries using AI logic and generates appropriate responses or
classifies support tickets efficiently.

Project Structure:
- .env                  → Environment configuration variables
- aiservice.js          → AI processing and response logic
- ai-support-system/    → Main project directory
- backend/              → Backend server files
- server.js             → Main server entry point
- package.json          → Project dependencies and scripts
- package-lock.json     → Dependency lock file

Key Features:
- AI-powered query analysis
- Automated response generation
- Backend API handling using Node.js
- Modular service architecture
- Scalable and structured codebase

Tech Stack:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- JavaScript
- AI API Integration

How to Run the Project:

1. Install dependencies:
   npm install

2. Configure environment variables in .env file

3. Start the server:
   node server.js
   (or)
   npm start

4. Access the API using:
   http://localhost:5000  (or your configured port)

Purpose:
This project demonstrates the implementation of AI integration in
real-world customer support systems to improve efficiency, reduce
manual effort, and enable intelligent automation.
